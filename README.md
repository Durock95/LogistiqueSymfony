LogistiqueSymfony

This project is based on a fictional logistical management web application introduced by our mentor and 
student group for Web and Mobile Web Development training course.
Since 2025-04-01 the project is evoluting by myself, adding MVC structure to build this application to its specifications.

You'll find a base for logistical company to manage suppliers, entries, products, categories, commands, users, 
with relational entities, access and views controllers, formulars to create or modifiy data into the database.

This project is using :
- PHP framework -Symfony- to manage Model / View / Controller
- Twig for the template engine
